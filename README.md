# React Router DOM: Handling Missing Routes

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router DOM v6 and how to solve it. The problem arises from missing routes when a user attempts to navigate to a path not explicitly defined in the `Routes` component. This can lead to unexpected behavior, like crashes or incorrect content display. 

The `App.js` file showcases the buggy implementation, lacking a catch-all route for undefined paths. The `AppSolution.js` file provides the solution by adding a `Route` with `path="*"`, effectively handling all unmatched routes gracefully.
